// Package agentickit carries everything an agentic stage needs to execute in a
// process that has no instance configuration.
//
// A mode-3 stage pod is that process. It holds no instance root by design — the
// same property that keeps a stage from reading the fleet's config — so an
// agentic stage cannot look its goober up. The kit is the alternative: the
// worker, which DOES have the config, resolves exactly one goober's execution
// inputs and hands the pod those and nothing else.
//
// TRANSPORT IS A CLAIM CHECK, not a payload. The kit is written to the blob
// plane the pod already reaches, and only its DIGEST is stamped on the pod
// spec. Two reasons, both load-bearing:
//
//   - A pod spec is readable by anything with namespace read. The kit carries
//     the run's goal, ownership boundary, context pointers and instructions;
//     none of that belongs in a listable object.
//   - Content addressing makes delivery VERIFIABLE. The pod rehashes what it
//     received and compares, so a substituted or truncated kit is detected
//     rather than executed. An endpoint keyed on run id could only return
//     "whatever the daemon says now" — there would be nothing to check it
//     against.
//
// This is the pattern Temporal itself prescribes for oversized activity
// arguments, and the storage already existed for surrender.
