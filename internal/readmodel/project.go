// §10 requires projector units to be "a pure function (prevRow, events) →

//
// Purity is not decoration here. It is what makes three separate things
// possible: incremental projection (apply only the tail past last_seq),
// rebuild-equals-incremental (the same function over all events), and a
// differential oracle against the journal-derived path (§14.7). A projection
// that reached for the clock or the filesystem would satisfy none of them.
//
// # What is deliberately absent
//
// No duration. It is now-relative for a running run, so storing it would freeze
// a quiet in-flight run's age at projection time (§5.3). The read contract
// computes it at query time from started_at and finished_at.
//
// No filesystem access. state.json is NOT consulted, even though
// summarizeRunForStage reads it to refine current_stage for a running run. The
// journal is the authoritative record (§3.2) and state.json can lag a
// crash-fsynced run.finished; a projection that mixed the two would be
// non-deterministic in exactly the case that matters. The projector's
