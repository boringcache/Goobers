// This file carries the implementation-lane behaviours ported from
// internal/runner under issue #3882 (decision 005, plan items E4–E9). Every
// one of them was runner-only, which meant a workflow driven by the engine
// reached a reviewer with less evidence, salvaged less work, and learned
// nothing across repasses compared with the identical workflow driven
// locally. The finding-002 inventory rows they close are named on each
// function.
//
// The organising constraint is that the engine's journal is WORKFLOW STATE,
// not a directory. The local runner reads its own history back with
// journal.OpenRead whenever it needs to look behind itself; the walk cannot,
// because reading a file is not replayable. So each ported behaviour is split
// the same way: the decision is a pure function over an event slice and an
// artifact resolver (exported from internal/runner or internal/gate, shared by
// both lanes), and this file supplies the engine's own view of those two
// things from the projection it is accumulating.

// projectedEvents renders the journal ops the walk has accumulated so far as
// the event log they will project to, together with a resolver for the
// artifact bytes those events reference.
//
// This is the engine's substitute for journal.OpenRead + Reader.Events, and it
// is exact rather than approximate, which is the whole point: writeProjectedRun
// replays each op as exactly ONE journal write (an artifact op becomes an
// artifact.recorded event, a span op a span.recorded, an append op the event
// itself), and journal's event log numbers events from 1 in write order.
// Sequence numbers are assigned from the number of events actually rendered,
// rather than the op index, so a future op kind that expands to zero or
// multiple events cannot silently shift the sequence used for learning-episode
// names. TestProjectedEventSeqMatchesProjection pins that correspondence
// against a really-projected run, because a learning episode's artifact NAME
// embeds the seq: if the two ever diverged the engine would name its episodes
// differently from the runner and the conformance diff would be the first
// thing to notice.
//
// Artifact bytes are inline in JournalArtifactOp.Data, so the resolver is a
// digest lookup with no I/O — and, unlike the runner's, it cannot fail for an
// artifact this run recorded.

// Three of these are decisions, not decoration, and that is why this is a

//
//   - A DUPLICATE diff forces escalation. Without it, a stage that keeps
//     producing a byte-identical tree would ride the ordinary repass budget
//     down to exhaustion, one synthesized needs-changes at a time, which is
//     precisely the loop #316 exists to cut short. The runner escalates on the
//     first duplicate; so does this.
//   - An EMPTY diff forces escalation for the same reason and by the same
//     route (internal/gate passes emptyDiff as resolveOutcome's
//     forcedEscalation argument). The distinction matters more than it looks:
//     routing an empty-diff fail to the gate's own `fail` branch would send a
//     degenerate run down an ordinary failure path, when what has actually
//     happened is that an agentic stage reported success while doing nothing —
//     a condition no branch of the workflow can repair and a human has to see.
//   - repassCause is journaled ONLY for a duplicate diff. The runner is
//     deliberate about that: on any other evaluation the cause is inferable
//     from the events themselves, whereas an unchanged repass is the one case
//     where the annotation carries the only record of what the implementer was
//     asked to fix and did not.
//
// The reason ladder is the runner's, in the runner's order: a finding
// transition names itself, a duplicate diff overrides it (the finding
// reconcile is skipped for a synthesized verdict anyway, so they cannot both
// be set), and any other escalation — including the empty-diff one — falls
// back to the budget code, which is what the runner journals there too.

// mechanism rather than an implementation detail. Both transitions can CHANGE
// the outcome — a needs-changes verdict whose every finding was already
// suppressed becomes a pass, and so does one whose every finding the diff
// disproves — so reconciling after resolveGateOutcome would journal a decision
// the findings no longer support and route the run on it.
//
// Delegated whole to internal/gate's shared helpers over a resolver backed by
// this run's own projection, so the two lanes cannot disagree about when a
// finding is settled. Prior episodes are read from the CONTEXT POINTERS, which
// is why the walk appends each injected learning episode to its pointer set:
// the pointer is not decoration, it is the input to this.
