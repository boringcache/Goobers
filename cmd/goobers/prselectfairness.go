// pr-select's FAIRNESS LEASE (#1336): the first-eligible timestamp per
// candidate PR that the 15-minute aging boost and the one-hour starvation
// guard are computed from. It is what stops a single PR monopolising the one
// pr-select slot.
//
// Since Goobers#3988 it is reached through the scheduler-state seam
// (openStageStateStore / openHeldStageStateStore) rather than through
// os.ReadFile + withClaimLock: the same file, in the same place, under the
// same claims.lock locally, and over the daemon's C2 plane from a stage pod —
// which is what lets `pr-select` run in a pod at all.
//
// Losing the lease in a pod does not degrade gracefully, which is why the fix
// is plane admission rather than tolerating the miss. A pod is never stamped
// GOOBERS_INSTANCE_ROOT, so the file would resolve under "." and vanish with
// the container: every run would read a FRESH lease, every candidate's wait
// would reset to zero, the aging boost would never accumulate and the
// starvation guard would never fire — silently, because a fresh lease is
// indistinguishable from a legitimately new one.
