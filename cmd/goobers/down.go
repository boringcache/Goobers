// down.go implements #2072: a CLI-native way to ask a live `goobers up`
// daemon to perform the same graceful drain-shutdown SIGINT/SIGTERM already
// trigger, from a separate terminal or from automation, without terminal or
// process access.
//
// This reuses the self-update supervisor's existing stop-request file
// (internal/selfupdate.RequestDaemonStop / ConsumeStopRequest) rather than
// building a second file-based protocol: `goobers up`'s supervisorStop
// goroutine (up.go) already polls for that exact file every
// delegationSweepInterval and, on finding it, calls stopDaemon() — driving
// the identical drain path SIGINT/SIGTERM would. Nothing about "this is a
// restart" is encoded in the stop-request file itself (that orchestration
// lives entirely in the self-update supervisor process), so a plain,
// non-restarting `goobers down` reusing the same file is exactly correct,
// not a repurposing of unrelated machinery.
//
// Deliberately NOT built on #169's planned daemon HTTP API, for the same
// reason rundelegate.go (#343) isn't: #169 is unbuilt and gated, so
// depending on it now would mean either unreviewed V1 design work or a
// parallel ad-hoc HTTP surface risking conflict with its eventual shape.
