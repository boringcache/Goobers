// engineRuntime is the late-bound half of an engineStarter's wiring.
//
// It exists because of an ordering fact in up.go that cannot be reordered
// away: buildSchedulerDefinitions — which constructs every scheduler entry
// and therefore every Starter — runs BEFORE newLiveJournalWriter and
// newDaemonEngineClient. The scheduler entries need Starters at construction;
// the Starters need a Temporal client and a live journal writer that do not
// exist yet. Moving the engine dial earlier is not available: the dial's
// configuration comes from the same config load the definitions come from,
// and a config reload rebuilds the definitions without redialing.
//
// So each engineStarter holds a pointer to this shared holder, and up.go
// attaches the runtime once, after the client and writer exist. Attach is
// idempotent and safe against concurrent Start calls.
//
// An unattached runtime FAILS the dispatch. It does not silently fall back to
// the local runner: a lane that the selection predicate placed on the engine
// has stages pinned to remote runners, and running it in-process would
// execute them on the daemon's host — the exact placement violation the pins
// exist to prevent. Failing is visible in the scheduler's run.finished echo;
// a silent fallback would not be.
